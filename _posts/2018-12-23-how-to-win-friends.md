I am very busy today so I decided to write the key points of a book written by *Dale Carnegie* just to keep the streak going. 

The book is titled **"How To Win Friends And Influence People"** and he highlited some key points on what to do if you want to make new friends and make people follow what you said (or at least the people around you likes you that much).


Here are the points that are listed in the book :

1. Don’t criticize, condemn or complain
2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.
3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.
4. Become genuinely interested in other people.
5. Smile
6. Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
7. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
8. Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.
9. Make the other person feel important – and do it sincerely.
10. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
11. Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.”
12. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
13. Begin in a friendly way.
14. Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately.
15. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
16. Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
17. Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.
18. Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.
19. Appeal to the nobler motives.
20. Dramatize your ideas.
21. Throw down a challenge.
22. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
23. Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.
24. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.
25. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.
26. Let the other person save face.
27. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”
28. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
29. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
30. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

Actually thanks to this [reference](https://fs.blog/2012/07/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/) for making a great summary of the book. I copy-pasted them from there. But I have read the book and it will show you how it will affect your life complemented with a real life example in everyday life. The writer also showed how famous people implement those things in their everyday life so that they can achieve what they earned: being lovable to people and somehow makes people follow what you ordered willingly.

Holiday is coming, yeay.

Holiday is indeed fun, sure. We can all agree. But one thing for sure that I want to do in this holiday is: **learning**. I do not want to waste my precious time with just watching Netflix and chilling (I will probably still do this, tho). I have got to earn something.

Inspired by *Fathia Izzati's* #31daysfchia where she vlogs every day for 31 days straight, I think it would be a great idea to make something similar: blogging. You guys clearly don't want to see me vlogging, right? 

So I decided to challenge myself to make this #30daysofwriting comes true. I will update this blog for 30 days straight. Hopefully I didn't mess up so I still can be *istiqomah* to make contents for this site. I will use either English or Bahasa. The content itself would be totally random, but it will be one of these three topics: 


1. Tech stuff that I learned (I planned to do some mini-project this month)
2. Book that I read (if i read any)
3. Random thoughts 



The aim for this challenge is to make myself get used to create writings and to share what I have learned in this winter. 

By the way, the site is built using *Jekyll*, a static-site generator written in *Ruby*. Check out their site [here](https://jekyllrb.com). I used the [Kactus](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) theme by *Nick Balestra* with some tweaks here and there.
 
See you tomorrow!

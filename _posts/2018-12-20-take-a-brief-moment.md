It has been a really tough semester. 

You have done your best, studying day and night, befriended your book like it's your partner. Those formulas, problems, pencils that you broke; keeps accompanying you every day. 

Seeing a friend got a better mark than you makes you sad. 

Seeing a friend got accepted to work in a reputable, prestigious company makes you jealous.

Seeing your juniors are better than you at something makes you feel anxious. 

Your parents keep telling you to study harder, seeing your grades are not good enough.

All I want to say is never give up. 

You and your friend are not competing at anything. 

You have got your own clock. Maybe it is their time to shine. You just have to wait and move forward. The shining time is yet to come.

Take a brief moment to take a look at yourself and be grateful. 

You have gone this far, passing all of those obstacles behind you. 

Just don't push yourself too hard, it might break the essence of what "*working hard*" really feels like. 

Work because you want to be a successful person, not because you want to be better than everyone else.

See you tomorrow!

There is this book that I always use as a go-to *"What is your favorite book"* questions. 

The book taught the readers at how to get everything that you want. By saying everything I mean literally **EVERYTHING**. Dream house? Admitted at a reputable university? Dream car? Hoping that your train will depart late so you can finally catch up? Anything.

Wanna know how?

##### Be Positive

Being positive here means that you are very certain that the thing that you want will finally come true. There is a paragraph of the book that shows me how crazy this method is. So there is this guy that practice this rule and want to know whether being very certain at what you want will really get you the thing that you want. So he thinks about a feather that has a unique pattern and he keeps thinking about it every day and night. One day, miracle happens, he found that feather when he walked down the street, shocked, realizing that it was the feather that he had been thinking about. 

I didn't believe it. How can a thing so random, when you keep thinking about it, will finally come true? No no no no. So I tried to implement it in a very simple use case: hoping that a key that I left somewhere in my class is still in my table's locker. Well as you may have guessed I finally found the key and started to believe on what the book told me. 

You should try. 

From now on, when I want something, I'll just be sure that God will grant my wishes. It just a matter of time, or if it seems that God does not grant our wishes, just be positive that He will show you a better way, a more surprising gift, a more beautiful lesson on patience. Never blame anyone, including yourself. Just be grateful at what you are right now and I am positive that He will show you the way. 

The book is titled **The Secret**, written by *Rhonda Bryne*. Crazy book, changed my life. May seems crazy and delusional at first but trust me it works.  

**Be +.**

See you tomorrow!
